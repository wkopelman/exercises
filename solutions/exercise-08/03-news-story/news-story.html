      <h2>Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Philippine, Russian Press Freedom Defenders</h2>

      <p>by VOA News</p>

      <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee Friday awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia “for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace.”</p>

      <p>At a ceremony in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen announced the winners, saying, “Ms. Ressa and Mr. Muratov are receiving the Peace Prize for their courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and in Russia."</p>

      <p>In a statement, the committee said Philippine journalist Maria Ressa, co-founder and executive editor of digital media company Rappler, is being recognized for her fearless use of freedom of expression to expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country.</p>

      <p>"I'm a little shocked. It's really emotional," Ressa told reporters shortly after the announcement.</p>

      <p>Ressa and Rappler have also documented how social media is being used to spread fake news, harass opponents, and manipulate public discourse.</p>

      <p>In an interview with VOA earlier this year, Ressa detailed multiple travel bans and government cases against her.</p>

      <p>“All told, all these charges carry a maximum penalty cumulatively...I think it's like 103 years,” she said.</p>
